// workflow.fire — spawn another workflow execution and return immediately.
//
// Fire-and-forget semantics: the caller does NOT wait for, or see, the
// child's outcome. Use it for side-effect flows (audit logs, notifications,
// re-indexing, telemetry pipelines) where the parent shouldn't be blocked
// on a child it doesn't need a result from.
//
// To get results back, you'd need a synchronous workflow.run primitive
// (BullMQ FlowProducer with parent-child dependencies) — deliberately
// not built here; this fire-only variant is the cheap, safe entry point.
//
// Cycle / depth protection:
//   • Each spawn carries an _ancestors list on the queue payload tracking
//     graph_ids in the current chain.
//   • The plugin refuses to spawn into a graph_id already in the chain
//     (catches A → B → A loops).
//   • Hard cap at 10 levels of nesting catches non-cyclic chains that
//     are still pathological (e.g. a linear A → B → C → … → K).
//
// The worker's processExecution forwards _ancestors from job.data into
// ctx so nested fires can see it.
